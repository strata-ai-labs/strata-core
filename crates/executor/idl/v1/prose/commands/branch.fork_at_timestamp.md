summary: Fork a new branch from a retained source timestamp.
mcp_description: Use this when the user wants to branch from an existing branch as of a point in time.
---

Forks a new branch anchored at a retained source timestamp (microseconds, on Strata's logical commit clock). The engine resolves the timestamp to the covering retained commit; the returned parent lineage records both the fork timestamp and the resolved fork version. A timestamp outside retained history fails with `history_unavailable.engine.persistence_history`.

This command has no dedicated CLI verb: the CLI expresses it as `strata branch fork <SOURCE> <BRANCH> --timestamp <TIMESTAMP>` (one shared `branch fork` verb routes to all three fork commands, so only `branch.fork` owns the CLI path). It remains fully reachable through the generic wire surface — `strata command run`, MCP, and SDKs.
